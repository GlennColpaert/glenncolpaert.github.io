I received the confirmation that I will be speaking at Cloud Developer Days 2020 in Krakow - Poland! 

Cloud DeveloperDays is a conference designed for software developers that get deployed to or integrates with any cloud platform. 
This years event takes place on **May 18-20 in EXPO Krakow**!

The two sessions I will presenting are:

> **Building Modern Integration Platforms With Azure Integration Services**

_In this session I will talk about the evolution of Enterprise Integration and give you an overview on the current state of Azure Integration Services._

> **Building the Data Sharing Platform of the Future**

_As data becomes the core value in more and more cloud-based solutions, building a platform that allows you to share data in a secure and reliable away is key. In this session, Glenn will guide you through some concepts of building a future-proof data sharing platform._


Tickets are available from the [Cloud Developers Day Conference](https://cloud.developerdays.pl/) website. I look forward seeing you there!
